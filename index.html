								<h2>Bringing jobs to life,<br />
								giving the power back to the employer.</h2>

								<p>VizCareerâ€™s technology product is designed to dramatically improve the way in which clients can identify and engage with specific talent pools, subsequently allowing potential candidates to engage back into a recruitment process, all on one integrated platform. Employers can manage and share their own campaigns, enhanced with our app technology and recruiting the most successful applicant. Essentially the traditional job advertising and candidate assessment elements are replaced by video adverts and video responses maximising the reach and power of social media.</p>

								For Munro, VizCareer has enhanced our approach to recruitment by allowing us to utilise leading edge recruitment technology as a means to innovate the entire recruitment process.
								<br><br>
								Our clients wish to attract more diverse and higher quality individuals and by introducing the VizCareer platform it now allows us to combine traditional search methodology, with state of the art technology. We have found this gives us a greater depth of attraction from  the likes of millennials and the more digital savvy candidates that clients specifically wish to target.
								<br><br>
								Also as a business, we can now handle many more vacancies per consultant than we could previously using only traditional methods as VizCareer controls all the targeted advertising and assessment elements within one portal, representing significant administration and time savings for both ourselves and our clients. VizCareer has enhanced the services we offer and transformed the way in which we can get the employer brand directly to the right candidate audiences first time and has allowed Munro to demonstrate a market leading approach to resourcing in the 21st century.
